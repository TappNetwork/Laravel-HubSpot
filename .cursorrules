# Cursor Rules

## Code Style and Quality
- Always run `./vendor/bin/pint` after making code changes to fix code style issues
- Always run `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` after making code changes to check for static analysis issues
- This prevents GitHub Actions from having to make style fixes and ensures code quality

## Testing
- Use Pest syntax for all tests (not PHPUnit)
- Use `test()` functions and `expect()` assertions
- Use `uses(RefreshDatabase::class)` for database tests
- Use `beforeEach()` for setup code

## Laravel Best Practices
- Follow Laravel 12 conventions
- Use proper dependency injection
- Use Eloquent relationships appropriately
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
